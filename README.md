# Responsive Pricing Cards (HTML & CSS)

This project is a small practice build focused on creating a **responsive pricing section** using only **HTML and CSS**.

No frameworks, no libraries, no tutorials — just building and adjusting until it works well across screen sizes.

## ✨ Features

- Responsive card layout using Flexbox
- Clean spacing and alignment
- Hover effects and subtle animations
- Simple, readable structure
- Scales well from mobile to large screens
- No media queries required

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox)

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was built purely for learning:
- Understanding Flexbox behavior
- Practicing responsive layouts without relying on breakpoints
- Improving UI structure and consistency
- Getting comfortable building components from scratch

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Resize the window to see the responsiveness in action

## 📚 Notes

This is part of my **“no tutorial” learning series** — build first, struggle a bit, then refine.

More improvements and experiments coming soon.
